Thursday Week 1 Challenge

Demonstrate your understanding of Java byte and character streams by creating a simple program.

Use any `java.io` or `java.util` APIs such as `Scanner` and `FileWriter` to prompt a user for a filename. Then either:
1. Read text from the user to save to that file.
2. Open and read an existing file by that name.
3. (Optional) Write to files with a byte stream or serialize an object.
